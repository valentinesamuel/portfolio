Vim is a clone of the vi text editor,  designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application.

## Background Story
I remember the first time I saw Vim being used in a YouTube tutorial. The first thing I unconsciously said was 'God Forbid' üòÇüòÇ. I got discouraged because I was already used to VSCode. After some years, I began falling in love with Linux and I managed to use Emacs. But the only thing I knew how to do was open and save files. My friend later told me Vi was easier and I refused to believe until I tried it. I am never going backüòç.

# What is Vi?
It is a screen-oriented text editor originally written in C and created for the Unix operating system by Bill Joy in 1976. If you love history, check the *[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi)*. It is also important to know that Vim is just flavor of Vi that stands for VI Improved. Vim and Vi pretty much uses the same commands.

## Why Should I Use Vim?
It is free, open-source and cross platform. It has a large community because it has been around for a very long time. It is extremely customizable. It uses less system resource. Vim supports multiple File Formats and Programming Languages and lots more.

Okay, let's get started so that you can understand these memesüòÇüòÇ..

# Modes in Vim
Vim has a total of 12 modes, although you will mostly use the following:
- ### Insert Mode
	This mode is used to insert text by typing, like you would do on any other text editor. To enter insert mode, type **`i`** while in command mode.
- ### Command Mode
	Also named Normal Mode, this mode is used to type Vim commands such as those you‚Äôll find in the Vim Cheat Sheet below. To exit insert mode and enter command mode, hit the **`Esc`** key of your keyboard.
- ### Visual Mode
	Similar to command mode, but used to highlight areas of text. Normal commands are run on the highlighted area, which, for instance, can be used to move or edit a selection. Press the **`v`** key to start visual mode. To exit visual mode, press the **`Esc`** key.

# Vim Shortcuts
Don't forget that these shortcuts are to be entered in [command mode](#command-mode). Because this is very long list. I have decided to group them into the following categories:
- Basic Operation
- Cursor Movement
- Searching
- Bookmark
- Deleting
- Editing
- Replacing
- Case Switching
- Text Indentation
- Copying and Moving
- Read and Write
- Interacting with Unix
- Alignment
